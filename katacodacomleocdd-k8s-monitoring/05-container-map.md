With data flowing into Datadog, you can now see your hosts and containers in real time!

The [Container Map](https://app.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/map?node_type=container&groupby=none) shows a visualization of running containers. Containers can be filtered and grouped by any tag.

Try creating some useful vizualizations on the container map:

* Group containers by `kube_namespace` then `pod_name` to see a high level view of pods by namespace.

* Group containers by `host` and `pod_name` to see the distribution of pods over nodes in the cluster.

* Get creative! What other kinds of useful groupings can you make?
