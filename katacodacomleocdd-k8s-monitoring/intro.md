# Welcome to the Dash 2019 workshop "Kubernetes Deep Dive: Catching & Preventing Failures"

All that you need are a basic working knowledge of Kubernetes, a modern web browser (which you'll be seeing this in), and your Datadog credentials.

We've taken the liberty of creating trial accounts for you so that you don't need to use your personal or work accounts.  If you have not received this, let the event staff know.

**Note:** *The hands-on environments in Katacoda have a lifetime of 3 hours from the time you first visit.*  The work that you do within Datadog will persist for the life of the account (about 1 week for these accounts we've provided.)
