Welcome to your personal workshop environment! Before we get started, let's explore.

First, a note on Katacoda:

* This is a "copy" command, clicking on it copies the command to your clipboard. Copy the text and add your name in the shell:
`export MY_NAME="<your-name-here>"`{{copy}}

* This is an "execute" command, clicking on it executes it directly in your shell. Try it now:
`echo "Your name is ${MY_NAME}."`{{execute}}
