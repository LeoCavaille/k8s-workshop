With data flowing into Datadog, you can now see your hosts and containers in real time!

The [Host Map](https://app.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/map?node_type=host) shows a visualization of running hosts.

The [Container Map](https://app.datadoghq.com/infrastructure/map?node_type=container&groupby=kube_namespace%2Cpod_name) shows a visualization of running containers. The container map can group containers by any tag; containers are grouped by `kube_namespace` and `pod_name` to demonstrate a high level view of the cluster.
